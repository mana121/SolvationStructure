# LiSolvXplore

**LiSolvXplore**: MD and DFT Study of $\ce{Li+}$ Solvation Structures in Ether and Carbonate Based Electrolytes at Varied Salt Concentrations

## Tutorials

This tutorial will guide you how to prepare electrolyte solution.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Obtain **OPLS-AA** force field parameters from [LigPargen](https://traken.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/) server
2. Use fftool
3. Use PACKMOL
4. Generate input files for running MD in LAMMPS and DFT in VASP
